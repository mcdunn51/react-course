///////////////////////////
//Enabling and using CSS Modules
for example scoping person.css to Person.js only 
In order to enable css modules you have to get rid of the radium stuff we used, and edit the build flow.
make sure to commit before running eject.
running the eject script does this.
running eject allows us to see and edit the build workflow. 
In the webpack.config.dev file scroll down to modules then where it says test: /\.css$/. Add modules:true and localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]' in the options object.
Do the same in webpack.config.prod file.
then import Classes from './App.css';
this will import the classes in app.css as a JS object, that will give you access to a string version of your CSS.
if you then want to apply a particular class to an element: <div className={classes.App}> (where App is one of the css classes in app.css)
once you've changed the build process you need to start it again. 
also simply doing: import './Person.css'; will no longer work. it has to be: import classes from './Person.css';
