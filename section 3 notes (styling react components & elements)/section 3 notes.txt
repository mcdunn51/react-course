//////////////////////////////section 3 notes 
The problem using global styles is they are applied to everything, the problem with inline styles is you can't use many of the features of CSS.

/////////////////
//setting styles dynamically
dynamically change button style depending on wether we're showing persons or not.


//////////////////
//setting class names dynamically
if there is 2 or less persons showing make the "this is worki9ng paragraph" bold
if there is 1 or less persons showing make it red and bold

///////////////////
//radium
as standard you can't use psuedo classes and media queries for inline styles in react so you can install radium which allows you to do this.
npm install radium
you can use it on components
export default Radium(App);
wrap psuedo selectors in ''
